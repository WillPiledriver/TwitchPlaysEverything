Twtich Extension "Chat Clicks" completed.

had a problem with pywin32, had to downgrade it. pip install --upgrade pywin32==303

Uses Direct Input Windows API using SendInput and scan codes instead of the older and more unreliable virtual keys. This improves compatibility especially with DirectX games.

Can also support mouse movement and clicking with typed commands if you don't want to use the Twitch Extension.
